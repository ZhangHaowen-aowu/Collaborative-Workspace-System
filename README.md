# Collaborative-Workspace-System 
## (2025 Sem 1, Supervisor: Dr Lau)
This project aims to develop a collaborative workspace system.  The system allows 
users to define a project, member and project task.  It provides functions of project 
scheduling, profiling and roles, progress tracking and status, and document 
versioning. 

## Project Objectives (It can be adjusted by students)  
(1) Design the databases, identify/collect/simulate the data, and draw object
oriented diagrams for the system’s functions. 
(2) Develop all these functions (i.e. a library’s function call), and group some 
functions into a class (i.e. program library). 
(3) Use text mining model(s) to analyze the project and skills information. 
(4) Use a data mining model model(s) for relating the project skill requirement and 
staff profiles.  
(5) Use data visualization to generate and visualize the project skills requirement 
and staff profiles analysis.

## Assessment
-  Group Project Presentation (10%)
-  Program Coding (25%)
-  Group project report (25%): no more than 4800 words (i.e. 1200 words per student).
